            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore theſe Peeres, who are your Peeres, and who have as noble juſtice in their hearts, as noble blood in their veynes, are this day to try you; therefore if you be innocent, ſpeake without feare, and bee ſure thoſe that accuſe you ſhall not eſcape free. But if you be faulty, I adviſe you to give ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God and the King, and confeſſe your fault, for it is no vaine confidence nor ſubtilty that can hide the truth; therefore if truth touch you at the heart, and your conſcience is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes, and God is greater then both, ſtand not againſt it; and if you doe not, God will put into the hearts of thoſe noble perſons to finde it out, and doe that is juſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Awdley</hi> ſaid, <q>I have beene a cloſe priſoner theſe ſix months, without friends, and without Counſell, and am but of a weak ſpeech at the beſt, and therefore I deſire to have the liberty of having a Counſell to ſpeake for me.</q>
            </p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:120643:4"/>that all my time, both in his Majeſties royall Fathers life, and ſince he came to his Crowne, I never had occaſion to ſpeake in this place againſt any Peere of the Realme before now, and God knowes I doe it now with ſorrow, and I hope I ſhall not have occaſion to doe ſo much againe; but his Majeſty who is the patterne of vertue, not onely as King, but in his perſon alſo, in whom it is hard to judge whether hee excell moſt in Juſtice or Mercy, but I rather thinke in Mercy, for he would have my Lord <hi>Audley</hi> the priſoner at Barre heard with as much favour as ſuch a crime as this can bee; when he firſt heard it, he gave ſtrict accoumpt that the triall ſhould bee ſearched, that his throne and people ſhould be cleared from ſo grievous ſins, and therefore he was indicted in his owne Countrey, according to the law, by Gentlemen of worth. The Bill is found, and now he is brought to this Barre to be tried by his honourable Peeres, ſuch as of whoſe wiſedome and ſincerity there can bee no queſtion, but to have an honourable hearing. And firſt, I ſhall beginne with the indictment of Rape, <hi>Bracton</hi> tells us of King <hi>Athelſtons</hi> law, before the conqueſt; if the party were of no chaſt life but a whore, yet there may bee a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is a good plea to ſay ſhe was his concubine; In an indictment of Rape there is no time of proſecution neceſſary, for: <hi>nullum tempus occurrit regi,</hi> but in caſe of an appeale of Rape, if the woman did not proſecure in convenient time, it will barre her for the <hi>crimen ſodomiticum,</hi> our law had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it till 15. <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which ſtatute it was made fellony, and in this there is no more queſtion, but onely whether it bee <hi>crimen ſodomiticum fine penetratione,</hi> and the law the 5. of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> ſets downe in generall words, and there the law doth not diſtingiſh, neither muſt we: I know you will bee curious how you give the leaſt mitigation of ſo abhominable a ſinne, which brought ſuch plagues after it, as we may ſee in Gen. 18.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:120643:5"/>Judges 14. Rom. 1. But my Lords, it ſeemed to me ſtrange at the firſt, how a noble man of his quality ſhould luſt to ſuch abhominable ſins, but when I found he had given himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to luſt, and find that <hi>nemo repente ſit peſsimus,</hi> and that if men once habit themſelves in ill, it is no marvell if they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any ſinne, and that he was conſtant in noreligion, but in the morning would be a Papiſt, in the afternoone a Proteſtant; I ſhall bee bold to give your Grace a reaſon why hee became ſo ill, he beleeved not God, then what may not a man runne into? but I find things beyond imagination, for I find his intentions bent to have his wife naught, which the wickedeſt man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I heard of before would have vertuous, and godly, how bad ſoever himſelfe be, and him lewd to his owne wife, if ſhe love him ſhe muſt love <hi>Henry Skipwith,</hi> whom he loves above all, and not in any honeſt love, but in a diſhoneſt; he gives his reaſon by Scripture, ſhe was now ſubject to him, and therefore if ſhe did ill at his command it was not her fault but his, and he would anſwer it; he lets this <hi>Skipwith</hi> who he calls his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, ſpend of his purſe 500. l'. <hi>per annum,</hi> and if his wife or daughter would have any thing, though neceſſary, they muſt lie with <hi>Skipwith</hi> and have it from him, and not otherwiſe; alſo telling <hi>Skipwith</hi> and his daughter, that he had rather have a child by him then by any body elſe. But this thing I had rather ſhould come out of the mouthes of the witneſſes then from me.</q>
